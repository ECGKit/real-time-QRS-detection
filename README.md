# Real-time-QRS-detection
## Purpose
A reliable QRS recognition algorithm would be of critical use in clinical senarios. The code, inspired by Pan & Tompkins, can hopefully realize a real-time detection of heart rate, Bradycardia, Tachycardia, Premature ventricular contractions and Atrial premature beats.
## Reference
The algorithm is based on the paper: Pan J, Tompkins W J. A real-time QRS detection algorithm[J]. IEEE transactions on biomedical engineering, 1985 (3): 230-236.
